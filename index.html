<h1>Hey, my name is Vincent</h1>

<p>
  I’m a <span class="hl">product-minded developer</span> that can help
  you <span class="hl">build an MVP</span>, define your
  <span class="hl">product strategy &amp; roadmap</span>,
  <span class="hl">improve your onboarding</span> or
  <span class="hl">review your code</span>. (Or someone else's.)
  I can also be your <span class="hl">interim CTO</span>.
</p>

<p>
  Basically I’m a jack-of-all trades that is useful in any development team,
  either at <span class="hl">start-up</span>, <span class="hl">scale-up</span>,
  or <span class="hl">grown-up level</span>.
</p>

<p>
  My main expertises are <span class="hl">Ruby on Rails</span>,
  <span class="hl">Javascript</span>, <span class="hl">Elixir</span> &amp;
  <span class="hl">product management</span>. If that sounds like the person
  you’re looking for, please <a href="mailto:{{ site.email }}">get in touch</a>
  or <a href="https://calendly.com/vincent-veenxyz/nice-to-meet-you/">
  book a slot for a short call in my calendar</a>.
</p>

<p>
  Previously I worked for various companies and clients like
  <a href="https://springest.com">Springest</a>,
  <a href="https://journa.com">Journa</a>,
  <a href="https://mychannels.com">Persgroep (MyChannels)</a>,
  <a href="https://d66.nl">D66</a> and ran my own startup
  <a href="https://careermatchapp.com">Cocoon (now CareerMatch)</a>. I would love to hear
  more about you and work on something great together.
